A little experiment with ThreeJS. Technologies I use for the site:
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library.
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first styling.
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations.
